        <p>Howdy, I'm Megalaoofania! (Mega for short).</p>
        <br>
        <p>I am a new person to the programming world.</p>
        <p>However I am not too expirenced, as I only know basic code of HTML, CSS and JS.</p>
        <p>But with the help of an indian guy on YouTube teaching me how to do things, I can learn a little more and maybe create functioning websites, games, or any other crazy thing a programmer can do.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I'm going to create some new stuff, so stay tuned!</p>
